I'm a passionate engineer who loves to tinker and learn new technologies. Currently I'm concentrating on mastering
his technical skills and trying to figure out what his next business venture will be. He also has a knack for photography, languages (not just the technical kind),
anything related to science and science literature and philosphy and religion (because who doesn't love an endless argument about the meaning of life).

Email him if you would like to get in touch at rafik@rafikmatta.com.

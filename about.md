I'm a passionate engineer who loves to tinker and learn new technologies. Currently I'm concentrating on mastering
my technical skills while also trying to figure out the next big challenge I want to take on. I also have a knack for photography, languages (not just the technical kind), anything related to science and science literature, and finally philosphy and religion (because who doesn't love an endless argument about the meaning of life).

Email me if you would like to get in touch at rafik@rafikmatta.com.
